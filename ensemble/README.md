# Ensemble models using HubberRegressor

The notebook must be run once all base models predicitons have been created in the `models_oofs` directory.

The weights for full train models are derieved form the weights of similar fold models. The weighst int he notebook are the oens used for the competition submisison. They are slightly diffeent from the weights obtained when rerunning the notebook.

The notebook was run in the same runtime environment as Molecular Transformer.
